## Exercise 1

### Proposition:

Every regular language can be generated by a LL(1)-grammar.

### Proof:

Consider a regular language $L \subset \Sigma^*$ with $\Sigma = \{s_0, \dots, s_k\}$. We'll construct a LL(1)-grammar G generating L explicitly.
Since L is regular, there exists a DFA $A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ recognising L.

Then, let $G = (N, \Sigma, P, q0)$ where $N = Q = \{q_0, \dots, q_n\}$ and P is given by:

$$q_0 \Rightarrow s_0 \delta (q_0, s_0) ~|~ \dots ~|~ s_k \delta (q_0, s_k) $$
$$ \dots $$
$$q_n \Rightarrow s_0 \delta (q_n, s_0) ~|~ \dots ~|~ s_k \delta (q_n, s_k) $$

and

$$q_i \Rightarrow \epsilon$$

iff $q_i \in F$.

G is obviously LL(1), since the result of every production starts with a terminal symbol and there is exactly one rule producing a string starting with any specific terminal symbol, so all the lookahead sets are disjoint.

Furthermore, a derivation starting at q0 and resulting in a word $w$ emulates an run of $w$ in $A$ because, at any given time, there is only one nonterminal symbol and there is only one possible production resulting in the next letter of w, which is taking the next step of the automaton as prescribed by $\delta$. Also, since $q_i \Rightarrow \epsilon$ for all $q_i \in F$, this run is accepting iff the derivation terminates.

## Exercise 2

### a)

### b)

### c)

First, to remove left recursion, transform rules 3 and 4 to these:

$$g \Rightarrow r ~ g'$$
$$g' \Rightarrow AND ~ g ~|~ OR ~ g ~|~ \epsilon$$

Then, to remove overlap in lookahead sets, factor rules 5 and 6 into these:

$$r \Rightarrow ID~r'$$
$$r' \Rightarrow EQ~ID ~|~ LEQ~ID$$

resulting in this full grammar $G'$:

$$ 1. ~ start \Rightarrow g$$
$$ 2. ~ g \Rightarrow r~g'$$
$$ 3. ~ g' \Rightarrow AND~g$$
$$ 4. ~ g' \Rightarrow OR~gd$$
$$ 5. ~ g' \Rightarrow \epsilon$$
$$ 6. ~ r \Rightarrow ID~r'$$
$$ 7. ~ r' \Rightarrow EQ~ID$$
$$ 8. ~ r' \Rightarrow LEQ~ID$$

which is now LL(1).

### d)

Let $DTA(G') = (\Sigma, X, [p], act, \vdash)$ with

$$\Sigma = \{ID,~EQ,~LEQ,~AND,~OR\}$$
$$X = \{start, g, g', r, r'\}$$
$$[p] = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$$ with the grammar rules numbering from c)

and $act$ given by this table:

$act$     | start | g     | g'    |  r     |  r'   |   ID  |   EQ  |  LEQ  |   OR  |  AND  |$\epsilon$
----------+-------+-------+-------+--------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+----------
ID        |(g,1)  |(r g',2)|      |(ID r',6)|      | pop   |       |       |       |       |
EQ        |       |       |       |        |(EQ~ID,7)|     | pop   |       |       |       |
LEQ       |       |       |       |        |(LEQ~ID,8)|    |       | pop   |       |       |
OR        |       |       |(OR g,4)|       |       |       |       |       | pop   |       |
AND       |       |       |(AND g,3)|      |       |       |       |       |       | pop   |
$\epsilon$|       |       |($\epsilon$,5)| |       |       |       |       |       |       | accept
