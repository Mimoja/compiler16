## Exercise 1

### (a)

This is not a thinkable state of the procedure stack.

Consider the third frame, starting with 4:5:. The static link points four cells further, while the dynamic link points five cells further.
Thus, the frame pointed to by the dynamic link would have to start in the same cell where the return address of the frame pointed to by the static link is located.
This is not possible during normal execution of an EPL program.

| 13 | 3  | 9  | 1 | 4  | 3  | 2  | 2 | 4  | 5  | 5  | 15 | 1  | 3  | 2  | 12 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 17 | 3 |
|----|----|----|---|----|----|----|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|
| sl | dl | ra |   | sl | dl | ra |   | sl | dl | ra |    | sl | dl | sl/ra | ?? | sl | dl | ra |    |   |


### (b)

This is a valid state of the procedure stack.

Every static and dynamic link points to the beginning of a different stack and ever dynamic link points to a frame nearer than the frame pointed to by the static link.

| 13 | 3  | 9  | 1 | 4  | 3  | 2  | 2 | 5  | 4  | 5  | 15 | 1 | 3  | 2  | 12 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 17 | 3 |
|----|----|----|---|----|----|----|---|----|----|----|----|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|
| sl | dl | ra |   | sl | dl | ra |   | sl | dl | ra |    |   | sl | dl | ra | sl | dl | ra |    |   |

### (c)

This is not a state of the procedure stack that can occur during regular EPL execution.

Although every static and dynamic link points to the beginning of a frame, the static link of the third frame points to the I/O frame. This means that the corresponding procedure can not see variables from the main scope. This is never the case in any EPL program.

| 13 | 3  | 9  | 1 | 4  | 3  | 2  | 2 | 8  | 4  | 5  | 15 | 1 | 3  | 2  | 12 | 0  | 0  | 0  | 17 | 3 |
|----|----|----|---|----|----|----|---|----|----|----|----|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---|
| sl | dl | ra |   | sl | dl | ra |   | sl | dl | ra |    |   | sl | dl | ra | sl | dl | ra |    |   |

## Exercise 2

These are the next four states of the AM:

| Next Instruction | pc | d    | p                                           |
|------------------|----|------|---------------------------------------------|
| LOAD(1,2)        | 7  | -3   | 9:4:26:3:7:4:3:36:5:10:4:40:1:2:5:4: ...    |
| ADD              | 8  | -3:2 | 9:4:26:3:7:4:3:36:5:10:4:40:1:2:5:4: ...    |
| RET              | 9  | -1   | 9:4:26:3:7:4:3:36:5:10:4:40:1:2:5:4: ...    |
| CALL(38,1,3)     | 26 | -1   | 4:3:36:5:10:4:40:1:2:5:4: ...               |
| ...              | 38 | -1   | 10:5:27:0:0:0:4:3:36:5:10:4:40:1:2:5:4: ... |
