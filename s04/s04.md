## Exercise 1

### Proposition:

Every regular language can be generated by a LL(1)-grammar.

### Proof:

Consider a regular language $L \subset \Sigma^*$ with $\Sigma = \{s_0, \dots, s_k\}$. We'll construct a LL(1)-grammar G generating L explicitly.
Since L is regular, there exists a DFA $A = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ recognising L.

Then, let $G = (N, \Sigma, P, q0)$ where $N = Q = \{q_0, \dots, q_n\}$ and P is given by:

$$q_0 \Rightarrow s_0 \delta (q_0, s_0) ~|~ \dots ~|~ s_k \delta (q_0, s_k) $$
$$ \dots $$
$$q_n \Rightarrow s_0 \delta (q_n, s_0) ~|~ \dots ~|~ s_k \delta (q_n, s_k) $$

and

$$q_i \Rightarrow \epsilon$$

iff $q_i \in F$.

G is obviously LL(1), since the result of every production starts with a terminal symbol and there is exactly one rule producing a string starting with any specific terminal symbol, so all the lookahead sets are disjoint.

Furthermore, a derivation starting at q0 and resulting in a word $w$ emulates an run of $w$ in $A$ because, at any given time, there is only one nonterminal symbol and there is only one possible production resulting in the next letter of w, which is taking the next step of the automaton as prescribed by $\delta$. Also, since $q_i \Rightarrow \epsilon$ for all $q_i \in F$, this run is accepting iff the derivation terminates.
